<h1>Act I: Robin Save the Queen<h1>

Scene I

*(courtyard outside of the main castle)*
*(skip button closes the dialog window)*

Robin:
    **<head pain>**
    Owwwwwwww
    
    My head...
    
    What happened last night?
    
    I remember drinks, the gang...
    
    Owwww
    
*(Main Castle comes into view in Dialogue Room)*

Robin:
    **<Confusion>**
    What club is this? 
    
    **<Shock>**
    Did they just leave me out here? Passed out?
    *Choose*: (
        1. Those dick-waffles!
            *If Selected* (
                **<anger>**
                I can't believe they just left me. 

                **<Anger>**
                Why... I'm never going clubbing with them again.
                
                **<Neutral>**
                Where did we even go?
                *(Continue with normal dialogue)*
                )
        2. They wouldn't! They couldn't!
            *If Selected* (
                **<default>**
                We must have gotten separated, 
                I'm sure they left a message on my phone
        
                **<feels for phone in pocket>**
                Let's see
        
                **<Shock>**
                Where is it?
                Oh no! Where even am I?
                *(Continue with normal dialogue)*
                )
            
        )
    
    **<Confusion>**
    I can't believe I just passed out somewhere
    I don't even recognize this place
    
    **<Confusion>**
    I don't see a road, is this someone's yard?
    I didn't think people still lived in castles
    
    **<default>**
    Maybe it's just a cosmetic touch. Like Monster House
    
    **<Default>**
    Or it's just a reeaally out of the way Night Club
    
    **<default>**
    Either way, they should have a phone I can use. 
    Hopefully they'll understand.
    
    **<Default>**
    And hopefully I didn't piss them off last night
    
    **<Head pain>**
    Uugh, standing up hurts

<h1>Scene II: Cell Phone's Dead<h1>


(Inside of Queen Roux's castle)
(skip button - see bottom of this scene notes)

Catherine:
    **<happy>**
    Ah, Robin, you're here!
    I was starting to get impatient.
    
    **<Happy>** 
    But don't worry, I forgive you
    
Robin:
    **<Cautious>**
    Hey, um, sorry if I did anything last night.
    
    **<Cautious>**
    I could really use a ride home
    could you call me a cab?
    
    **<Cautious>**
    Wait... How do you know my name?
    Did we meet last night

Catherine:
    **<Proud>**
    Hohoho
    Don't you know a Titular character when you see one?
    
Robin:
    **<Confused>**
    Look...
    I just need a ride
    
Catherine: 
    **<Pride>**
    Oh don't you worry, you'll understand soon enough.
    
    **<Pride>**
    I was quite surprised myself when I first showed up.
    But badabing badaboom, here I am giving you you're exposition.
    
    **<Default>**
    Now, all you need to know is that the Queen has been kidnapped
    by the evil queen and needs to be rescued by a brave hero
    
    **<Default>**
    That's you B-T-W
    
    **<Pride>**
    In order to save the Queen from all the torture,
    you'll need to defeat the dangerous Dragon guarding the castle
    
    **<default>**
    Not this one, it's a bit aways from here
    
Robin:
    **<Confused>**
    Wow
    Look, I just need to call a Cab, do you have a Cell Phone or not?
    
    (Catherine Pulls out a Sword)
    **<Shock>**
    
Catherine:
    **<Pride>**
    BEHOLD the Dragon Blade, the Legendary Sword which shall lead you unto victory
    
Robin:
    **<Confused>**
    Where were you keeping that?!!
    No, forget that, just, point that somewhere else, 
    you're going to poke my eye out
    
Catherine:
    **<Neutral>**
    Look, you either get this or the Amulet of Protection, 
    and I don't see you slaying Dragons with a Pendant
    
Robin:
    **<Anger>**
    I don't want to kill anything! 
    
Catherine:
    **<Neutral>**
    Pacifist Run huh? I can respect that. 
    Keep that single-mindedness about you and you'll do great things.
    
    **<Neutral>**
    Look, Do you want the sword or the Amulet?
    *Choose*: ((Same as yours really, good writing there)
        1. Sword
        2. Amulet
        3. BOTH!
        4. Neither, you're crazy
