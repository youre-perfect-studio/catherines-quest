Act I: Robin Save the Queen

Scene I

(courtyard outside of the main castle)

Robin:
	<head paid>
	Owwwwwwwwww......
	My head is killing me....
	I must have partied too hard last night.
	I don't really remember...

	<surprise>
	Wait, where am I?
	I can't believe I just passed out outside somewhere.
	Uhh... is this somebody's yard? That sure is a huge
	castle-y-looking house if so. Maybe this is some new
	nightclub my friends dragged me to.

	<default>
	Well I better get up and get moving before someone
	sees me and calls the cops.

	<head pain>
	Ugh standing up sure hurts...

(player can now move around freely)

Scene II: Cell Phone's Dead (that's a Beck song)

Catherine:
	<happy>
	Ah Robin! You made it here!
	 Thank goodness, I was getting little worried.

Robin:
	<cautious>
	Sorry for uh... letting myself in.
	I'm kind of lost and thought maybe
	you could help me call a cab.
	wait... how did you know my name?
	did we meet last night?

Catherine:
	<proud>
	Don't be silly Robin, of course I know your name.
	_I_AM_ the titular character after all.

Robin:
	<confused>
	...

Catherine:
	<default>
	Well anyway, you have been brought to us because
	our beloved Queen Roux has been kidnapped by the
	sadistic Dark Queen, and you are fated to save her.
	I can only imagine the torture she is undergoing
	right now!

Robin:
	<annoyed>
	You've got to be kidding me.
	Can I just borrow a cell phone?

Catherine:
	<confused>
	Self... hone...
	<default>
	Oh! Of course, the mystical self-honing
	Dragon Blade that belongs to my father.
	Where are my manners. Yes you may
	 borrow either my father's sword
	or the Amulet of Protection to use in your quest.

Robin:
	<annoyed>
	How 'bout you just tell me how to get hom?

Catherine:
	Dearest Robin, please be careful!
	You're single-mindedness will manifest itself
	in unexpected ways! So which would you like?

	1. Dragon Sword
	2. Amulet
	3. Neither.
	4. Why not both?

---

Choosing 1 or 2 (amulet or sword):

Catherine:
	<happy>
	Thank you so much Robin! You will find our
	beloved Queen locked away in the Dark Queens
	castle in the swamps and bayous to the north west.
	Watch out for the dragons!

Robin:
	<annoyed>
	Yeah ok... dragons... thanks.

---

Choosing 3 (Neither):

Catherine:
	<surprised>
	Wow you really are brave Robin!
	Are you sure you wan't to leave without borrowing
	either of the magical items?
	
	Yes, leave without either item
	No, choose an item

(yes will end the dialog and the player is on their own)
(no will show a dialog like)
	1. Dragon Sword
	2. Amulet
	3. Why not both?

---

Choosing 4 (Why not both):

Catherine:
	<default>
	I fear that single-minded determinism
	is both your strength and your weakness.
	To put it another way - you can only carry
	one item at a time.

Robin:
	<confused>
	Only one item at a time? So you are telling me
	I'm physically incapable of carrying a sword
	and an amulet at the same time?

Catherine:
	<default>
	Yes.

Robin:
	<confused>
	Well what about these clothes and this cloak
	that I'm wearing? Are you saying I have to
	be naked to wield your sword?

Catherine:
	<default>
	Well you are not really my type...
	Just kidding, no your clothes and cloak
	don't count as items.

Robin:
	<annoyed>
	Why because I'm wearing them?
	<triumphant>
	Well, what about if I'm wearing the
	Amulet of Protection, then can I also
	wield your sword? Or what about if I
	put the Amulet of Protection around
	your sword?

Caterine:
	<annoyed>
	I'm afraid not, I said you are not really
	my type. Look if you want to know the real
	reason you can only carry one item...
	its because the Atari 2600 only had 128 _BYTES_
	of memory. It couldn't even hold the text of a
	single tweet in RAM.

Robin:
	<really annoyed>
	That makes no sense! How do you know what
	video games and twitter are but you don't
	know what a cell phone is?!

Catherine:
	<confused>
	Self... hone...
	<default>
	Oh! Of course!

Robin:
	<annoyed>
	You said that already.

Catherine:
	Oh, right! Well, out with it then, which would you like?
	1. Dragon Sword
	2. Amulet
	3. Neither.
	4. Why not both?
